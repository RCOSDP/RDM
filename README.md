# Introduction
The Research Data Management Application Profile (RDM-AP) is an application profile developed to describe all activities related to research data management. RDM-AP was developed as a communication hub between the NII Research Data Cloud (NII-RDC) systems, but is being developed as an ontology that can be applied to any research data management platform. RDM-AP is defined by extending the Activity Streams 2.0 Terms, W3C Document 13 April 2018 (https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#.) published by W3C.

# Objectives
The purpose of RDM-AP is to represent the lifecycle of NII-RDC compliant research data as a metadata specification that can be described in RDF. The phases covered by RDM-AP are the management, publication, discovery, and potentially future extraction phases that comprise the research data lifecycle.
